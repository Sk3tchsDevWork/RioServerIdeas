## 🧠 Design Proposal: Split Drug Gameplay into Territories & Properties

### 🎯 Goal:

Balance two core player types:

* **Risk-oriented solo/duo grinders** (grow, sell, evade DEA)
* **Territory-focused gangs** (PvP, turf wars, black market control)

### 💡 Core Concept:

> Allow **coexistence** between high-risk solo tycoon play and structured gang warfare to avoid turning the entire server into constant PvP (like Five Life), which overshadows economic mechanics.

### 🔄 Coexistence System

| Group Type          | Gameplay Style                    | Ownership Model          | Purchase From       | Primary Threat        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Solo / Duo Grinders | Grow, craft, sell, evade          | Legal Properties         | Government or front | **DEA**               |
| Gangs / Cartels     | Control turf, fight for resources | Black Market Territories | Illegal Vendors     | **DEA + Rival Gangs** |

---

### 🔥 Territory Zones

* Purchasable **drug territories** (labs, grow ops, smuggling routes)
* Buyable via **illegal black markets**
* Faction-only access
* **Turf war system** (capture zones, defend raids)

---

### 🧊 Legal Properties

* Buyable by anyone (solo or group)
* No turf control or PvP obligation
* Focused on **crafting, upgrading, and silent selling**
* Heat system + DEA patrols still apply

---

### ✅ Why This Works

* ✔️ **More player diversity**
* ✔️ Attracts grinders *and* PvP players
* ✔️ Avoids burnout and constant wars
* ✔️ Creates **natural escalation** from legal to illegal ownership
* ✔️ Supports cartel factions without alienating casuals
